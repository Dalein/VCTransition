{"name":"VCtransition","tagline":"DropDown ViewController transition (aka iOS 8 Mail app swipeable VC) in 200 strings","body":"\r\n#VCTransition\r\nThe heart of this project is GITransition object, it adopts `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` and `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` protocol, which allows you to have one view controller at the bottom, and on the same time keeping your main navigation separate. This was inspired by the iOS 8 emails implementation where you can have your new email open at the bottom while still viewing all your old emails above it.\r\n\r\n#Demo\r\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dalein/VCTransition/master/demo.gif)\r\n\r\n#Example\r\n```objectivec\r\n    transitionManager = [[GITransition alloc] init];\r\n    self.transitioningDelegate = transitionManager;\r\n    \r\n    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"Main\" bundle:nil];\r\n    controller = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@\"vcAddNewGoal\"];\r\n    controller.transitioningDelegate = transitionManager;\r\n    controller.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;\r\n    controller.transitionManager = transitionManager;\r\n\r\n- (IBAction)show:(id)sender {\r\n    [self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nCopy GITransition folder into your project.\r\n\r\n# License \r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\n this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\n the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\n use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\r\n of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\r\n so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n If you happen to meet one of the copyright holders in a bar you are obligated\r\n to buy them one pint of beer.\r\n\r\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
